# vt-smash-thumbnail-creator

The program will read from the csv files Matches and MatchesDoubles to create the thumbnails.
You can take a look at the current file and the "Completed_Thumbnails" folder to get a sense of how
the thumbnails are created.

In the future I will add the feature to change backgrounds as well.
